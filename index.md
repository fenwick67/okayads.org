We the Users of the internet and the world-wide-web do hereby lay out a framework for creating tolerable advertising within interactive media (ads).  These are our Terms and Conditions.

Version 0.0.1

# Preamble

Online advertising has been around since the dawn of the web.  However, we have come to a point in time where targeted advertising has crossed a line into an immoral, will-undermining industry.

Today, advertisers are at war with users over attention and data.  We want to change the advertising relationship from parasitism to symbiosis.  We believe a middle-ground can exist where advertisers can continue, while users still retain their privacy and free will.

We don't just want ads that are better, we want ads that respect us and don't undermine our intent.  These are what we call "okay ads".

# Guidelines

## Ads Must Not...

1. Deceive users
    * This includes disguising itself as a regular part of the host content
    * This includes lying, be it about a link, product, application, article, reality, or anything else
2. Profile users (individualized advertising)
    * This includes pseudo-anonymized data like the user's interests, previous activity, products they've purchased, et cetera
    * This includes fine-grained location information about the user (<200 miles)
    * This includes accessing other services to determine user information
3. Track a user beyond how they interact with the ad during the session
    * This includes tracking users past any sort of navigation outside of the host content, or past whenever the ad becomes imperceptible
4. Require active interaction to access the host content
    * This includes forcing the user to point their eyes at an ad before proceeding to the host content, requiring a survey, selection, click, gesture, or other action

## Ads Must...

1. Be obviously and clearly labelled as advertisements

## Ads May...

1. Target users based on the host content's intended target audience
    * For example, a blog targeted at gardeners which has an entry about tulips can aptly have an advertisement for tulips
    * This targeting can be done manually or in an automated fashion based on the host content
2. Track the way a user interacts with the ad for the duration of the ad interaction
    * Examples include clickthrough rates, number of users that hover the ad, the number that click or glance at the ad, et cetera
    * This data must be anonymized, and not tracked beyond a singular interaction
3. Attempt to determine which country or general geographic area (no smaller than 200 miles) the user is located in to determine what or how to advertise to the user, or to evaluate ad effecacy
4. Attempt to determine which language(s) the user uses

## Ads Should Not...

1. Be annoying
    * Ads that interrupt an interaction, interject, distract, guilt, or irritate a user are anti-patterns.  
    * This requirement is marked as "should not" because it is highly subjective, but it should not be interpreted as unimportant.
